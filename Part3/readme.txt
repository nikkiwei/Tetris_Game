This is the readme file for Nikki Wei.

This is the GUI version Tetris program.
When user runs the program, the game and scores will be displayed on the screen.
A new piece will automatically falling, and user can move it down, right, left with arrow keys
or rotate it with key x for clockwise and key z for counter-clockwise.
The new piece always starts at (3, 0) on the board.

I also fixed some problems that my text version Tetris has.
