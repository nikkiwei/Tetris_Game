This is the readme file for Nikki Wei.

This program is all the skeleton classes for the tetris game project.
If running without the command line arguments, the program runs the GUI version
If running with the arguments "text", the program runs the text version
The two model classes, TetrisBoard and TetrisPiece are the same for both versions

I didn't use the method in the InteractiveSumLoop example in this design
because I don't understand it

Also, I am not sure about the actionPerformed method in GUI Controller class,
do I write the code for animated falling in that method body?
